Patents tend to cite other innovations that inspired them, from which directed graphs can be constructed. One can then identify the categories that these innovations fall under by exploiting their International Patent Classification (IPC) codes at various hierarchical levels. The resulting graphs can be used to identify the most productive ideas in a given field, strongly influential categories of patents and some predictive ability over future innovations. [Here](../../annotated_presentation.pdf) are some snapshots of some briefly annotated slides that explore the project.
