The paradigm of **measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC)** uses careful sequences of measurements on entangled qunatum states to perform computation. Because the approach can be erroneous, and naturally expressible in the diagrammatic language of the ZX-Calculus, there exists a nice interplay between the graphical representation and physical faulty lattices that contain the system. **Percolation theory**, which studies the behaviour of graphs when you remove some of their components, helps describe the limitations in computational power when the quantum resources are imperfect. These ideas are brought together [here](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/aleks.kissinger/theses/george-thesis.pdf).

You can watch a video of a talk discussing this work for the **ZX-Calculus seminar** [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-_h0nBQ7rQ), because of connection issues, slides for the presentation are available in the video description.
