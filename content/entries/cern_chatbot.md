The **ATLAS collaboration** at CERN is one of the largest particle physics experiments in the world, and accordingly produces a vast amount of data and resources that can be difficult to navigate. In order to overcome this, a proposal was made to integrate **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** techniques into a chatbot interface which would enable researchers and doctoral students to find relevant information.

In science, it is important to link results back to their original sources, so as to allow researchers to conduct subsequent investigations. Presentations of this approach are available [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1395528/contributions/5877957/attachments/2833825/4951736/chATLAS%20IML%20Meeting%20(1).pdf) and [here](https://indico.bnl.gov/event/19560/contributions/83300/attachments/51306/87732/Chatlas%20Overview.pdf).
