I work on complex systems, which is about understanding how
simple interacting elements give rise to emergent phenomena that cannot be explained by components in isolation. To do this, I use methods from statistical physics, Bayesian machine learning and network theory.

Some things I find interesting are:
- Spin models
- Belief propagation
- Combinatorial optimisation
- Approximate inference
- Graphical models
- Energy-based models
- Inverse problems
- Causal inference
- Graph neural networks
- The renormalisation group

I am a first year PhD student in the **Probabilistic Systems, Information and Inference Group** at the University of Cambridge. I have a background in theoretical physics.
