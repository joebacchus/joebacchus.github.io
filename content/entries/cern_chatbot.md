The **ATLAS collaboration** at CERN is one of the largest particle physics experiments in the world, and accordingly produces a vast amount of data and resources that can be difficult to navigate. In order to overcome this, a proposal was made to integrate **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** techniques into a chatbot interface which would enable researchers and doctoral students in finding relevant information.

Importantly, the ambition was to be able to link results back to the original sources from which it provided information, so as to allow researches to conduct subsequent investigations.
