The paradigm of **measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC)** uses careful sequences of measurements on entangled quantum states to perform computation. The approach can be erroneous, and is naturally expressible in the diagrammatic language of the ZX-Calculus.

There exists a nice interplay between the graphical representation and physical faulty lattices that contain the system. **Percolation theory**, which studies the behaviour of graphs when you remove vertices or edges, helps describe the limitations in computational power when the quantum resources are imperfect. These ideas are brought together [here](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/aleks.kissinger/theses/george-thesis.pdf).

You can watch an online talk discussing this work for the **ZX-Calculus seminar** [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-_h0nBQ7rQ). Because of connection issues, slides for the presentation are available in the video description.
